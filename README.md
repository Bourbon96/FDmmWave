# FDmmWave
Algorithmic solution for hybrid beamforming on full-duplex millimeter wave communications. This algorithm implements the LowRes algorithm from the paper "1-bit Phase Shifters for Large-Antenna Full-Duplex mmWave Communications" recently accepted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications. 

The main function of the algorithm is named wmmse_hybrid_precod.m, and the other functions are called within it.
